Certainly! Below is a sample README file for the Wi-Fi Jammer Detection application:

# Wi-Fi Jammer Detection 

This is a Wi-Fi jammer detection application designed to monitor and detect potential Wi-Fi jamming events. The application runs on a Raspberry Pi and continuously scans nearby Wi-Fi networks, calculates moving averages, and sends Wi-Fi signal data to a server for analysis. When potential jamming is detected, alerts are sent to the server.

## Features

- Continuously monitor Wi-Fi signal strength and moving averages.
- Send continuous updates to the server for analysis.
- Detect potential jamming based on multiple thresholds (warning and alert levels).
- Monitor the number of visible Wi-Fi networks as an additional indicator.
- Monitor packet loss using ping tests.
- Send alerts to the server when jamming is detected.
- Display the latest jamming events and their details on a web interface.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi with Wi-Fi capabilities /ESP8266 or other device with Linux ).
- Python 3 and the following Python packages:
  - requests
  - time
  - subprocess
  - re
  - statistics
- Flask and Flask-SocketIO for the web interface.
- A server to receive and analyze Wi-Fi signal data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install requests Flask Flask-SocketIO
   ```
3. Set up the Flask app on your server. Refer to `app.py` for the Flask app code.
4. Run the application on your Raspberry Pi:
   ```
   sudo python3 raspbery.py
   ```

## Configuration

- Modify the `ssid` and `password` variables in `raspbery.py` to match your Wi-Fi network.
- Change the `server_url` variable to your server's URL or IP address.
- Adjust the `threshold_multiplier` and other threshold values in `raspbery.py` to suit your detection requirements.

## Usage

1. Run the application on your Raspberry Pi using the command provided in the installation step.
2. The application will start scanning nearby Wi-Fi networks and send the data to the server.
3. The web interface on the server will display the live signal strength and moving average.
4. When potential jamming is detected, alerts will be sent to the server and displayed on the web interface.
5. The latest jamming events and their details will be shown on the web interface.

## Note

- This application is designed for educational and testing purposes only.
- Jamming detection is based on signal strength, moving averages, visible networks, and packet loss, but false positives or negatives are possible.
- Adjust threshold values and other parameters based on your environment and requirements.
